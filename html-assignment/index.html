    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm <em>a passionate</em> graphic designer with a <strong>strong eye for detail</strong> and a love for visual <em> storytelling. </em> With experience in print production, branding, and digital design, I create compelling visuals that blend creativity with functionality. In this ever-evolving digital landscape, a brand's identity is its soulâ€”a captivating story that resonates with its audience and sets it apart from the rest.

        Born on December 9 <sup>th</sup> 1998, I embark on a journey of discovery, understanding the essence of each entity I collaborate with. <strong>As a brand and logo designer,</strong> I strive to create bold, unique designs every day. Creativity drives me, whether in design or gaming. I'm a huge fan of <abbr title="Call of Duty">COD</abbr>, Star Wars, and One Piece.
